# Image viewer with PyQt5
_______________

_You can see the working of the GUI by running the **call_image_viewer.py** file_

Provided you have to keep the `image_viewer.py` file in the same directory

### Issues:
  1. The `QGraphicsView` widget size is not *changing* on *resizing* the dialog window
  2. I want to **remove the scroll bar** appearing on the QGraphicsView widget,
but want to have a full view of the image as any other normal image viewer.  
_(you can think of dynamically changing the widget position to maintain the position on the window)_
